# Snake
This snake game provides a greater challenge than the ones you're usually familiar with.
However, please note, this game is still flawed as apples spawn randomly even under the enemy snake
which makes it impossible to achieve.

Simple Rules:

1. Eat the apples as much you can.
2. The head of the snake is the only vulnerable part of the body - so as long
as it doesn't make contact with the enemy snake, you're fine.
3. Warping allows the snake to telepot to the opposite side if it crosses the game's boundaries.
